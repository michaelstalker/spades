Add scorekeeper
Add judge or rulekeeper
	This is where you should add values to each card
	Also add <=> method for cards here?

Add players
Make one player the dealer
	Should the dealer shuffle or the deck? Probably the dealer. Add a shuffle method to the Dealer class.
		class Dealer
			def shuffle(deck)
				# Delegate the shuffling task to deck. Dealer doesn't need to know
				# the cards are an array.
				deck.shuffle
			end
		end
